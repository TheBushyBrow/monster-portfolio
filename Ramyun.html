                                <h1 class="entry-title">Git & GitHub Project</h1>
                                <p>I started this project knowing 3 things.</p>
                                <ol>
                                	<li>1. I want to learn Git</li>
                                	<li>2. If I am using Git, I should probably incorporate GitHub</li>
                                	<li>3. Lastly, I want a living example of my hard work hosted on GitHub<br /><br /></li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>So I came up with this ramyun site. It's a fairly simple idea that was inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/anna_debenham">Anna Debenham</a>, who made a <a href="http://teamethod.co.uk/">Tea Method</a> site. I thought it was a pretty cool idea to share your simple recipes and I have always prided myself on making a tasty bowl of ramyun. So, I thought I'd share my secrets.</p> 
                                <p>After sketching out a pretty simple and easy-to-ship webpage, I dived right into some Git training hosted on the <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">Team TreeHouse</a> site. I heard about this site initially from <a href="http://chriscoyier.net/">Chris Coyier</a> on his podcast <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/">Shop Talk Show</a> and checked it out. It is beautifully designed and formatted. Simply, it was pretty enough to keep me interested.</p>
                                <p>So what do I have to say about Git? Well, honestly I believe there is a very steep ramp-up to Git. I had to practice a lot and go back to my notes many times over to answer the quiz questions. The cool thing about TreeHouse is that it has this environment where I can make constant mistakes. So I did just that and now that I have finished the course, I can comfortably say that I understand the basics of Git and could probably hop into a basic project using it.  What will be interesting is using Git on a much larger project and messing with merging branches, conflicts and keeping track of which branch I'm working in.</p>
                                <p>Once I had completed the training, I wanted to start pushing my webpage onto GitHub. This actually wasn't nearly as difficult as I thought it would be. Fortunately this process of working with GitHub was covered in my training as well. The tricky part was figuring out how to host a page on GitHub and have it pop up with your custom domain. That was a headache but I figured it out after a few hours of poking. I use <a href="https://www.hover.com/">Hover</a> for my domain registering and could find little to no up documentation on how to configure the domain so that it would communicate with GitHub. I will probably post my notes on that later.</p>
                                <p>Overall, I am really happy with this little project. I not only got to level up my Git skills, I also was able to ship a little side project I have been wanting to do for a while. </p>
                                <p>Two birds, one stone.</p>
