                        <p>Hi there~</p>
                        <p>I have compiled a SHORT and SWEET list of podcasts that I listen to. Not only are they informative, they tend to be pretty entertaining as well!</p>
                        <p>The Big Web Show - <a href="http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow  ">http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow</a></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="indent-1">This is by a guy who pretty much invented the idea of web semantics, Jeffery zeldman.  He runs a great website for cool web articles AListApart.com and on this podcast, he interviews key people who do web development/design. I check it out like once a week, sometimes the shows a little dry. I suggest listening to the one with SwissMiss <a href="http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow/81">(http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow/81)</a></li>
                        </ul>
                            <br />
                        <p>The Great Discontent - <a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com">http://thegreatdiscontent.com</a></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="indent-1">Ran by a couple, Ryan and Tina Essmaker who are designers and developers. They have a really sick site that interviews creative people in fields like web design, photography and illustration and then transcribe it on their site. Not only is it really informative/inspirational, it is also beautiful to look at (though some of the pictures are so large on your screen its awkward)</li>
                        </ul>
                            <br />
                        <p>Shop Talk Show - <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/">http://shoptalkshow.com/</a></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="indent-1">Awesome podcast, definitely in my top favorites.  Co-hosted by Chris Coyier (He runs CSS-Tricks and writes loads of helpful CSS articles) and Dave Rupert  (I'm not sure what he does but he’s funny) who answers questions on the show about common CSS problems or the current “hot drama” in the web world. Its pretty funny. I like how they have two different formats: One is a Rapid-Fire where they just answer questions quickly and Two is a podcast where they have a cool guest and they answer questions together.</li>
                        </ul>
                            <br />
                        <p>Let’s Make Mistakes - <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/">http://shoptalkshow.com/</a></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="indent-1">So this one is a big time hit or miss. It’s a show all about design but rarely talks about it J They get on tangents a lot but can be pretty fun to listen to. Its hosted by Mike Monteiro, who is just a super awesome designer in SF with a lot of strong opinions. If you try this out, I would suggest an earlier show from when they first started. Its more design orientated and they actually answer questions.</li>
                        </ul>
                            <br />
                        <p>Unfinished Business - <a href="http://unfinished.bz">http://unfinished.bz</a></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="indent-1">My favorite show at the moment. Co-host by Andy Clark (Awesome web designer, just google him I love him) and Anna Debenham (web developer who does a lot of game console testing). They have just the right balance of fun and actually being informative. They don’t talk about web techniques as much as they talk about how to be a freelance web designer.  Very interesting show, great guest appearances and I think you could jump anywhere in the shows and be alright, though the beginning is a very good place to start.</li>
                        </ul>
                            <br />
                        <p>Happy Monday - <a href="http://www.happymondaypodcast.com">http://www.happymondaypodcast.com</a></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="indent-1">I just started listening to this show. Ran by Sarah Parmenter and Josh Long who are designers, they post a new podcast every Monday. They try to keep this shows to about 30 minutes long. During each show they interview guest (usually web professional) and ask them what their inspiration is, how they started, what they are working on, etc. It’s a cool show to listen to because it short and sweet. The Aaron Draplin episode is probably my favorite so far, no. 028.</li>
                        </ul>
                            <br />
                            <p>So here’s my list! I usually listen to these all day at work, that way your like 2x as productive working and learning haha</p>
